# VSCO-de: the Design Journey

## Target Audience(s)
> Tell us about your target audience(s).

My target audience is for the photographers who like to travel and like their photos to be at the center of the showcase. Their photos have a great depth of color and composition which stand out best against a plain background. This audience likes to adventure and explore, and thus the user will be able to see all images at once in the gallery view and in the tag view. This website reflects this target audience with minimal design to let the photos speak for themselves.

## Design Process
> Document your design process. Show us the evolution of your design from your first idea (sketch) to design you wish to implement (sketch). Show us the process you used to organize content and plan the navigation (card sorting), if applicable.
> Label all images. All labels must be visible in VS Code's Markdown Preview.
> Clearly label the final design.

## Design Patterns
> Explain how your site leverages existing design patterns for image galleries.
> Identify the parts of your design that leverage existing design patterns and justify their usage.
> Most of your site should leverage existing patterns. If not, fully explain why your design is a special case (you need to have a very good reason here to receive full credit).
